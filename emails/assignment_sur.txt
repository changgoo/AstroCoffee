Dear Ankan,

Thanks for agreeing to host astrocoffee this semester. I've assigned tentative host dates from July to September (the calendar can be found at https://changgoo.github.io/AstroCoffee/intro.html). These are the dates you are scheduled to host astrocoffee:

I've tried my best to take into account your restrictions, but please let me know if the assigned date didn't work for you.

Thanks for hosting astrocoffee!

Best,
Chang-Goo Kim
