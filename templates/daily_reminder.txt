Subject: AstroCoffee Reminder
Dear {name},

The usual gentle reminder (unnecessary, but ritual) that you are scheduled to host astrocoffee 10:30 {day} {date}. Coffee should be available in Grand Central.

As usual, the astrocoffee program is at

https://coffee.astro.princeton.edu/astroph-coffee/papers/today

The zoom url for astrocoffee is

https://princeton.zoom.us/j/94585414825

If there are "local" papers with students or postdocs, please try to give the local authors an opportunity to present, as time permits.


Thanks for hosting astrocoffee!

Best,
Chang-Goo Kim

            The Usual Information

**Mac Mini in Grand Central doesn't work. Please use your laptop.**

If you are hosting "in person", please try to use the owl. The "owl" is in Mami Akiyama's office (Peyton 114). If you trouble to set up the owl, please let me know.
