Subject: AstroCoffee Assignment
Dear {name},

Sorry for sending another email regarding coffee assignment. I found some flaws in the first assignemnt. Please ignore the first one.

Thanks for agreeing to host astrocoffee this semester. I've assigned tentative host dates from October 2024 to January 2025 (the calendar can be found at https://changgoo.github.io/AstroCoffee/intro.html). These are the dates you are scheduled to host astrocoffee:

I've tried my best to take into account your restrictions, but please let me know if the assigned date didn't work for you.

Thanks for hosting astrocoffee!

Best,
Chang-Goo Kim
