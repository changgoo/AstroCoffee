Subject: AstroCoffee Reminder
Dear {name},

The usual gentle reminder (unnecessary, but ritual) that
you are scheduled to host astrocoffee 10:30 {day} {date}.
Coffee should be available in Grand Central.

As usual, the astrocoffee program is at

https://coffee.astro.princeton.edu/astroph-coffee/papers/today

The zoom url for astrocoffee is

https://princeton.zoom.us/j/6927104575

===========================================================
            The Usual Information

If you are hosting "in person", please try to use the owl.
The "owl" is in Mami Akiyama's office (Peyton 114).
New "beta" set-up instructions for the owl are attached. If you have
suggestions for corrections/clarifications/additions to these
instructions, please let me know.  We need improved instructions;
anything you can suggest to improve them would be helpful.

After you connect:

1. make yourself "host": click on "participants"; at the bottom of the
participant screen, click on "Claim Host"; enter the HOST KEY = 652625

2. After you become host, you will see a "security" icon, which you can
click on to get a menu, and then click on "allow screen sharing".

Reminder to coffee hosts:

Please try to prioritize presentation by students and postdocs in our
department!  If there are "local" papers with students or postdocs,
please try to give the local authors an opportunity to present, as time
permits.

Thanks for hosting astrocoffee!
